# Hunger-Free-Society
Telegram bot built using python-telegram-bot that links people with leftovers to those who need the food


## Getting Started
1. Create a Telegram bot using the command /newbot with [BotFather](https://t.me/botfather). Get the API key of your bot.
<!-- ![alt text](https://miro.medium.com/max/1266/1*XxKPtfrohg3GX5Sq18w-NA.png "Chat with BotFather") -->
2. Create a Telegram channel.
3. Download the three files in this repo: bot.py (containing your python code for the Telegram bot), requirements.txt (containing the python libraries to be installed), and Procfile (containing the command to execute the python file).
4. Modify the line in the bot.py file `'TOKEN = 'YOURTELEGRAMBOTTOKEN'` to the API key of your bot, and the `chat_id = 'YOURTELEGRAMCHANNEL'` to the link of your Telegram channel.
5. Set up the Google Maps API:
  1. Go to the Google Cloud Platform [console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
  2. Search for API & Services in the search bar.
  3. Click on the blue plus button saying ENABLE APIS AND SERVICES right below the search bar.
  4. Search for Geocoding API and enable it.
  5. Under API & Services, go to Credentials and select CREATE CREDENTIALS > API key.
6. Modify the line in the bot.py file `GMAPSAPI = 'YOURGOOGLEMAPSAPITOKEN'` to your Google Maps API.
7. Follow the steps [here](https://github.com/liuhh02/python-telegram-bot-heroku) to set up an account and an app on Heroku.
8. You're done! Send `/start` to your bot and it should respond with the following message:
> Hi! I am your posting assistant to help you advertise your leftover food to reduce food waste. To start, please type the location of the leftover food.

## My Implementation

# HUNGER FREE SOCIETY

## Abstract
This idea is in alignment with United Nations Sustainable Development Goals Goal 2 (Zero Hunger) and Goal 12 (Responsible Production & Consumption) to make the world “Hunger-Free” and achieve “Zero Food Waste”.
We are envisioned to make the world ‘Hunger-Free’ and move towards achieving ‘Zero Food Waste’ through innovative solutions and methodologies to create a global social impact.

Our goal is to feed people, not landfills.

Keywords—United Nation Sustainable Development Goals, Hunger-Free, Zero Food Waste.

## I.	INTRODUCTION 

Unlike everyone else we don’t want money as donations from people. We aim to approach the issue of hunger with a sharing-economy model. The donation of excess food enables a vital, yet often wasted, resource to be used to its full capacity.
Our aim is to serve the surplus excess foods from weddings, parties, and other events, to the hungry and deprived. This is achieved through just by clicking picture of the food and uploading it to our telegram channel with a short description about the food (like no. of servings, date it was cooked etc.)  through where our automated bot will collect the information about the food and will display it to our website which will work as one stop destination for our volunteers as well as the needy people to book the food through our website. 
We can float the images of food as well as location in our social media handles, which can increase our reach to the needy people and to the nearest volunteer present…people nearest to the location can also come forward to book the food, collect it and then help the needy people they find.

## II.	PROBLEM STATEMENT ADDRESSED

A.	Technology for Humanity
With this idea we really feel that the dream of a hunger-free world can be achieved.
B.	Upliftment of Covid Affected Industries
After the impact of Covid-19, many workers from various industries have lost their jobs and don’t have enough money to afford even one time meal. Our idea can support them.
C.	AI and ML for futuristic Innovation
We will be using upcoming technologies like Cloud Computing and Blockchain in order to run our automated bot and the website efficiently.
D.	 Hunger-free World and Zero Food Waste.

## III.	BASIC IDEA

Our aim is to serve the surplus excess foods from weddings, parties, and other events, to the hungry and deprived.
        
             Excess --- Needy

We aim to bridge the gap between these two states. 

## IV.	INNOVATION

This is achieved through just by clicking picture of the food and uploading it to our telegram channel with a short description about the food (like no. of servings, date it was cooked etc.).  
Yes, it’ll be that simple!
Our automated bot will collect the information about the food and will display it to our website which will work as one stop destination for our volunteers as well as the needy people to book the food through our website. 

## V.	SOCIAL RELEVANCE

•	Feeding needy and in-distress people by surplus food (both pre-packaged and fresh and cooked food) recovered through standard safety procedures and promote innovation in surplus food recovery and distribution.
•	To sensitize people about food waste through facilitating standardized food waste auditing methods and to provide alternative solutions for spoiled or wasted food.
•	Raise awareness about food loss and food wastage amongst citizens and bring about behavioral change in them to prevent food waste through guidance and good practices.
•	Raise awareness amongst food businesses by encouraging them to adopt best practices to reduce food loss and food waste in their supply chain, production and distribution cycle.
•	Provide policy, strategy and program support for food loss and waste reduction initiatives through coordinated efforts.

## VI.     SCALABILITY

* The idea is not only limited to food but can also be implemented for cloths, books & toys for children, utensils and many more.
